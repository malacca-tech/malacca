# Intro
**[Malacca](https://www.malacca.tech/)** is a cloud native declarative enterprise service bus.

### Why Cloud Native ESB

> In this era of cloud computing, the technology stack of the Internet industry is at the forefront.Cloud native,container,service mesh,micro service are widely adopted.  
> But industry software is still in the progress of gradual transformation.
> So does the kernel (ESB) under SOA architecture lose its meaning of existence?  
> Of course,In the Internet industry with a very high degree of overall self-research and the formation of platform and microservices,
> ESB is no usage.
> However, it can be seen that the future 2B and industry software will still face non self-developed heterogeneous system integration, protocol conversion and other scenarios.
> This is why Malacca.  
> Malacca can integrate the advantages of ESB in SOA Architecture (unified service entry, heterogeneous system integration, protocol transformation and routing)ï¼Œ
> but also uses the latest cloud native technology. Container based can be easily deployed on kubernetes for large-scale ops.
> At last, the simple and declarative service configuration can let your service easy to write and manage.  
> Because of this, you can also manage your service by git ops to improve the convenience of management.
